/**
 * @file
 * An HSADriver is an emulated driver that controls an HSA agent,
 * or more simply put, an HSA device. An HSA device is a device
 * that has an associated HSA packet processor.
 *
 * In the base HSADriver class the open() method is implemented, as
 * well as the mmap() call, which maps the HSA packet processor's
 * doorbells. Drivers for other HSA devices should derive from this
 * class and implement the necessary methods; typically this is an
 * ioctl() method that satisfies the ioctl requests needed to manage
 * and control the device.
